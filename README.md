# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply to elements as expected.  The hover effect is specifically broken, preventing changes to the background color on mouse hover.

## Bug Description

The provided code snippet intends to create a button with a red background that changes to a darker red on hover. However, the Tailwind CSS classes don't seem to be working correctly, resulting in no visual change when hovering over the element.

## Solution

The solution involves checking several potential causes:

1. **Ensure Tailwind is correctly configured:** Verify the `tailwind.config.js` file is configured correctly and includes the necessary paths to your CSS files.  Also, make sure that the `content` option is correctly set to include all the files where you use Tailwind classes.
2. **Check for conflicting CSS:** Check your CSS for any styles that might overwrite your Tailwind classes.
3. **Purge unused classes (if applicable):** If you're using the `@tailwind` directives and purging, ensure that the element's classes are not getting removed during the build process. You can temporarily disable purging to check if this is the issue.
4. **Correct class names:** Double check for typos or errors in the class names.
5. **Browser Compatibility:**  Ensure you are targeting a properly supported browser version and that your CSS is properly parsed by the browser.
6. **Make sure there's no javascript interfering:** JavaScript can interfere with the class applications.
7. **Check if you have the correct version of tailwind:** A bug may exist in your version of tailwind.
